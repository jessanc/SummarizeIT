          <p>A recent phone call with my sister went something like this.
        “Maya, I just had a really hard experience, I feel so ashamed and alone and I feel like I let myself down.”
        I hold my breath, waiting for my sister to amplify my shame. Instead, she says,“Girl! I had a similar experience a few years ago, let me tell you about it!”
        I exhale, immediately brought back into community by my sister’s mutual vulnerability.
        My sister and I often speak to one another in story form. I tell her a story about my day and then she responds, indirectly, with a similar experience. We then unpack these parallel instances together and tie our experiences to one another through the lens of our shared Black womanhood. In doing this, we are engaging in mutual-sight. I see my sister fully, she sees me fully, and we grant ourselves permission to feel. Further, through our storytelling, we remind each other that we are not alone, thus rejecting the isolation of marginalization by owning our stories, together.
        Upon further examination, I realized that this exchange of conversational storytelling is not limited to my relationship with my sister but is a common occurrence in my friendships with Black women.
        I learned the immense power of reciprocal story-sharing in my master’s program, which forced me to confront misogynoir in its most violent forms. A liberal kid from California thrust into the conservative racial politics of Massachusetts, I found myself in emotional crisis. The more I stood up for myself in the classroom, the more alone I felt. Therefore, instead of fighting systems of oppression on my campus, I began to internalize my experiences. The more I internalized them, the more shame I felt. College degrees do not protect us from the emotional impact of intersectional subjugation; they simply grant us language to articulate the trauma of our experiences. I can explain how systems of oppression work until I am blue in the face, and still cry in my room after a particularly hard day.
        Serendipitously, another Black woman in my program reached out to me. She invited me to dinner and we talked for hours about instances of pain and trauma in our master’s program. Though I must admit that this sounds like a bleak affair, I left our dinner emotionally liberated. Yes, I lamented our dehumanization, but I also felt the power of the resilience that lies in community. Suddenly, I no longer felt consumed by feelings of mis-belonging. We were not the malaligned ones; our stories revealed that our program failed to care for us.
        By boldly claiming our narratives, we are rejecting the erasure of our lives; we are reminding one another that our stories are worth telling.
        Friendships with Black women sustain me. They are my life force. Oftentimes, being a Black woman constitutes a life of invisibility, particularly emotional invisibility. Our White female counterparts are allowed to display a tapestry of emotion while Black women are barred from embracing the fullness of our emotionality. It is within my friendships with Black women that I am free to be myself. Free to own my experiences in the absence of fear and shame.</p>
